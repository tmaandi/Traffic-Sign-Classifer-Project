    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the LeNet Deep Learning Model architecture to train a convolutional neural network based classifier to classify/recognize 43 different German Traffic Signs. Various data-preprocessing techniques (like normalization, mean zeroing etc), followed by a LeNet neural network augumented by regularization techniques (like Dropout, learning rate decay) are used in this project. In addition to the pre-segregated test data, the trained network is also tested on 5 randomly chosen images from the Web.\n",

    "To train the model, I used AdamOptimizer. The initial validation accuaracy from LeNet was about 87%. The batch size was gradually decreased from 128 to 16 and the number of epochs were increased to 15. Though it increased the training time but significantly helped with the validation accuracy.\n",

    "#### 4. Iterative Improvisations/Additions\n",
    "The first modification I did was adding the Dropout layer which helped the model to have a more generalized training and not overfit for some particular set of nodes. Also, I observed that model's validation accuaracy was oscllating about a value after a few epochs. It appeared that a high learning rate was causing this. So I introduced the learning rate decay as a function of validation accuracy but it didn't solve the problem that well. Then I tried learning rate decay based on the epochs, i.e, gradually decreasing the learning rate with increasing number of epochs. This helped. I did not play with the hidden layer depths which might or might not have resulted in better performance.\n",
